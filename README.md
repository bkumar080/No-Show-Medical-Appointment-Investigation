# No-Show-Medical-Appointment-Investigation
Data Analysis of No-Show Medical Appointment

## Introduction

The dataset under investigation is a collection of information from 100k medical appointments in Brazil and is focused on the question of whether or not patients show up for their appointment. Various characteristics about the patient are included such as Gender and Age as well as each individual's primary health designations such as Hypertension, Alcoholism, and Diabetes. Six months of appointment data are assessed below.

Questions to be investigated:

What is the patient age distribution of no-shows versus shows?
What is the patient health designation breakdown of no-shows versus shows?
Which neighborhoods have the highest number of no-shows?
What is the breakdown of no-shows versus shows by patients that received SMS reminders?
Do no-shows have a larger timeframe between schedule date and appointment date?
Do appointment no-shows occur on specific days of the week?
Are there any trends in appointment no-shows versus shows over time?

##Methodology

The general methodology followed to perform the investigation:

Data Wrangling. Moving raw data into dataframes for manipulation.
Data Cleaning. Transforming data to uniform format.
Data Analysis. Exploring data and patterns.
Data Visualization. Visualizing and drawing conclusions.

## Conclusions:

This exploratory analysis was able to correlate time between schedule day and appointment day and appointment reminders with higher appointment show rates. Running statistical analyses on these areas would be a good next step to better understand which of these factors impact appointment show rates the most and hone in on what conditions yield better appointment show rates.
